  Hi {{ $toName }},
  <br/><br/>
  I hope your {{ $day }} is going well.
  <br/><br/>
  Iâ€™m reaching out today because I noticed your firm's website was a little out of date. I find businesses with older websites and offer to modernize them.
  <br/><br/>
  I have a starting point that I think would look great for your firm - you can find it here:

  </a>
  <br/><br/>
  If you like what you see, I'm happy to get started working on a full redesign as soon as I hear back from you. Please let me know!
  <br/><br/>
  Best regards,
  <br/>
  Rocky
