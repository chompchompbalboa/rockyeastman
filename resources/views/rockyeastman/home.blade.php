									<h3>It doesn't get easier than this</h3>

										I start by working with you to build a brand new website perfectly designed to suit your needs. From there, adding or updating content is as simple as sending me an email. I make most changes that very same day.</br>

									<h3>I build to your budget</h3>
									<p>I don't want cost holding your business back from upgrading your online presence. So I have you set the budget. You name the price - I build your website for that amount or less.</p>

										<h2>Clean, focused design that<br />
										looks great on every device</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										These days, most people are accessing websites from multiple different devices. It's crucial that your site looks great on all of them. That's why every site I build is designed to deliver content perfect for any device.</br></br>
										I also work with you to determine what you want your customers to do once they get to your website. Trying to direct people to your products? We'll make that the focus. Prefer that they reach out to you in-person? We'll make sure your contact information is front and center. </br></br>
										Your website should have a well-defined purpose that helps grow your business. I make sure that happens.

										<h3>1. Outline the project</h3>
										<p>Here's where we figure out what you want your user's experience to be. We'll decide on basic content and functionality and make sure that we're building you a website that caters directly to your customers. We'll also look at some designs, define what you want your site to look like, and determine what we can build that's within your budget.</p>
									</section>
								</div>
								<div class="4u 12u$(small)">
									<section class="tree">
										<span class="icon major fa-coffee"></span>
										<h3>2. The design proposal</h3>
										<p>Then I get to work building you the first draft of the site. I take the ideas we discussed during the outline and put them together into a basic version of your website. You'll have the ability to preview this site and provide feedback before we decide to move forward.</p>
									</section>
								</div>
								<div class="4u$ 12u$(small)">
									<section class="tree last">
										<span class="icon major fa-camera-retro"></span>
										<h3>3. Contract time</h3>
										<p>Once you've decided we're heading down the right path, we finalize the budget, deadlines, and deliverables and sign a contract to those terms.</p>

									<section class="tree first">
										<span class="icon major fa-list"></span>
										<h3>4. Let's build this thing</h3>
										<p>Now comes the fun part. I get to work on the production version of your site. Similar to the design proposal, you will have constant access to a live preview and the ability to provide feedback throughout the process.</p>

								<div class="4u 12u$(small)">

										<h3>5. Time to go live!</h3>
										<p>Once I've finished building your website and you've given the go ahead, we move everything over to your domain. We work out any hiccups that might come up and do final testing to make sure that you are completely satisfied with your new website.</p>

										<h3>6. Ongoing management</h3>
										<p>From here on out, any changes you'd like to make just requires sending me an email. Want to add another product to your online store? Just send me the details. Hired a new employee and want to update your company photo? Send me the new one. You never have to worry about trying to figure out how to do things. I make it as simple as possible.</p>
